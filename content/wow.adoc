I think I want to start writing everything in AsciiDoc. It's real cool.

I can include source code like this:

[source,java]
public static void main(String[] args) {
  System.out.println("This is a useless program.");
}

This is going to allow me to write a bunch of things about technology.

Ciao, bellas!
