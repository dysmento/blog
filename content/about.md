## Who Is This Guy?

Hi, my name is Zach Thomas. I was born in Lubbock Texas all the way back in 1975.

Reading way above my grade level did not get me as far in life as I had hoped. I'm a software
engineer, but I'm fond of saying I'm an "information farmer," because it's a good characterization
of this type of work.

In 1998, my best friends moved to Austin to live with me and start a band. That band is called
[Okkervil River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okkervil_River), and I'm very proud of it. Will Sheff
is the genius behind it, and I played bass and mandolin, and some vox.

## dysmento?

Is that some kind of disorder, like heartburn of the brain? Yeah, kind of. A long time ago, I was
thinking about how it really helps to have a unique name to use around the internet, and I stumbled
upon a website (long since lost to the sands of time) that generated pronounceable -- but not real --
words. I picked dysmento, and it works great, because this word literally doesn't appear in the
universe except in connection with yours truly.
