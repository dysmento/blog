I’ve been studying to take the https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional/[AWS Solutions Architect Professional] exam, and it is hard.

I’ve been good at test-taking in the past, but I’m not going to just skate through this one. I took the practice exam they have for $40, and I bombed it pretty hard. But they did identify areas of weakness to enable me to focus my study.

Here’s a partial list of topics you have to know well to get this certification:

* EC2
* Storage Gateway
* Route 53
* CloudFront
* CloudFormation
* Elastic Load Balancer
* IAM
* VPC
* Direct Connect
* RDS
* KMS
* DynamoDB
* Directory Service

I’ll be sitting the exam on December 15th. Wish me luck!
