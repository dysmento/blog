How time flies! It's been eight years since my last post! Since the internet is well on its way to being
covered in rot, I've decided to take back the means of production. What does that mean? It means I don't
want to host my content for the benefit of Zuckerberg, Musk, Pichai. People didn't realize that on all
these social media, the reason it was free is that _they_ were the product, and it has gotten pretty bad.
